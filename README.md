# Fortran-On-Web


The following projects compile `Fortran` code to `Webassembly` and execute in your browser.


We have used the [LFortran](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran) compiler ([26c7a79](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/tree/26c7a7976708f2d595a0ab64f0d531b43518f200)) to compile the `Fortran` codes.
